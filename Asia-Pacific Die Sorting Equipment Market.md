IDMs are companies that design, manufacture, and package semiconductor devices. They are increasingly adopting die sorting equipment to improve their production efficiency and yield rates. These manufacturers use die sorting solutions to ensure that the semiconductor dies meet stringent quality standards before being assembled into final products. IDMs often need highly specialized and customized sorting solutions to meet their unique production requirements, especially for advanced semiconductor technologies such as 5G chips, automotive semiconductors, and memory devices. The increasing complexity of semiconductor designs and the miniaturization of devices drive the need for more advanced sorting solutions in this segment. On the other hand, OSAT companies focus on providing outsourced services for semiconductor assembly and testing. These companies are also significant users of die sorting equipment as they handle large volumes of semiconductor components from various IDMs. OSAT providers use die sorting solutions to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of their sorting processes, which in turn allows them to meet the stringent requirements of their customers. The use of die sorting equipment in OSATs helps to improve the yield, reduce operational costs, and ensure the overall quality of semiconductor products. This subsegment is particularly focused on adopting automation in sorting systems to handle high throughput efficiently while minimizing errors. As OSAT companies expand their presence in emerging markets and increase their outsourcing capabilities, the demand for die sorting equipment in this segment is projected to grow significantly.</p><h2>Key Trends in the Asia-Pacific Die Sorting Equipment Market</h2><p>Several key trends are shaping the Asia-Pacific Die Sorting Equipment Market.
