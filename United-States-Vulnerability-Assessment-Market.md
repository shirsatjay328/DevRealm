This includes concerts featuring male artists, male-centered performance films, and TV shows that focus on male audiences or predominantly male casts. Notable subgenres within this category include rock concerts, male solo artist performances, action-packed performance films, and male-oriented drama series. The popularity of male performers in live concerts and TV shows is often influenced by their widespread fanbase, leading to increased ticket sales, viewership, and digital streaming numbers.

This subsegment includes genres such as pop concerts, female solo artist performances, and TV dramas with predominantly female casts, often centered around themes of empowerment, family, or romance. The increasing demand for female representation across various entertainment platforms has led to more productions that highlight women in both musical and cinematic performances, providing diverse and relatable content to female audiences.<p>Moreover, women-focused content has become increasingly popular in the digital streaming sphere, as subscription-based platforms create original series and concert films designed specifically to cater to female audiences. The demand for live concerts and performance-based content featuring female artists has also been buoyed by the continued success of high-profile tours, albums, and performances by global superstars such as Beyoncé, Taylor Swift, and Ariana Grande.

Television networks and streaming platforms alike recognize the potential of children's content, and this demographic has become a focal point for concert performance projects.<p>As children’s entertainment continues to diversify, more concert and performance-based content has been developed to cater to specific sub-groups within this age range.

The increased demand for inclusivity and representation across all forms of media has led to the growth of this category, with a wider array of performance artists and filmmakers catering to these diverse communities. <p>One significant trend within the "Others" subsegment is the rise in niche concert performances, including performances by emerging artists from different cultural backgrounds and genres that traditionally have not been mainstream. These performances can range from indie music concerts to multicultural dance performances and avant-garde theater. As digital streaming platforms provide more room for niche content, the "Others" category is expanding to accommodate a broader spectrum of tastes.
