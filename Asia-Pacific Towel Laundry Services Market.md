As hotels continue to grow in number, particularly in tourist hotspots such as Thailand, Indonesia, and India, the demand for efficient and cost-effective laundry services increases. Hotels require a steady supply of fresh towels for guest rooms, bathrooms, and public spaces, ensuring a high standard of cleanliness for their clientele.
